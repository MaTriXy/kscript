* Direct script arguments `kscript 'println("hello kotlin")'` (fixes [#18](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript/issues/18))
* More robust dependency resolution with more informative error messages


Support API improvements
* Kotlin DocOpt helpers to build CLIs ([example](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript-support-api/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/kscript/test/DocOptTest.kt))
* New [utilities](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript-support-api/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/kscript/StreamUtil.kt) to automatically resolve arguments files and stdin to `Sequence<String` for by-line processing

Other changes
* Allow dependencies to be declared in multiple lines prefixed by `//DEPS` (fixes [#2](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript/issues/2))
* To ensure long-term stability of `kscript` we've added a suite of [unit tests](test/TestsReadme.md). The repository tested continuously by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/holgerbrandl/kscript)
* Cache directory is now `~/.kscript`
* More heuristics to guess `KOTLIN_HOME`
* Cache cleanup `--clear-cache` now applies to jars, scripts, urls, and cached dependency lookups

 (fixes [#15](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript/issues/15))
